Billie Holiday revolutionized singing with her unique style of small ensemble vocal jazz called Swing Song. Her vocal style, strongly inspired by jazz instrumentalists, pioneered a new way of manipulating phrasing and tempo. Her innovations provided the blueprint for generations of singers and instrumentalists to come. She was known for her outspoken opposition to racial injustice. Her song "Strange Fruit", a protest song against racial violence, became an instant hit in 1939.
