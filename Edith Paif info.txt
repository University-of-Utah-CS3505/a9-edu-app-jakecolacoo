Edith Piaf, the iconic French singer, had a profound impact on the music scene in the 1940s. Her interpretation of the chanson, or French ballad, made her internationally famous. During World War II, she was one of the most popular performers in France. Her concerts for German servicemen were controversial, but she later claimed to have been working for the French Resistance. In 1945, Piaf's signature song, "La Vie en Rose" was published, further increasing her fame. She became France's most popular entertainer in the late 1940s, touring Europe, the United States, and South America.
