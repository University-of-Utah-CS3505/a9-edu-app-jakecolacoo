The 1930s, a decade marked by economic and political turmoil, saw the maturation of jazz into more danceable swing. Swing bands like Duke Ellington's and Benny Goodman's ruled the airwaves, their powerful brass solos igniting some optimism amidst the gloom of the Great Depression. As the decade progressed, swing gave way to the sounds of big bands like Glenn Miller’s. The combination of the increasing popularity of radio and the emergence of “talkies” (movies with recorded audio) saw the emergence of multimedia stars like Bill Cosby.
