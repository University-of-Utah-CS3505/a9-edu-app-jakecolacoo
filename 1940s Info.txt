The 1940s saw swing, the dominant sound of the late 1930s, give way to the faster, more improvisational bebop within jazz. This decade also saw the gradual replacement of big band sounds with crooners and vocalists of standards post-World War II with artists like Frank Sinatra or Nat King Cole. This period also laid the groundwork for rock and roll through the blues evolving into rhythm and blues (R&B), boogie-woogie, and “jump blues”.
