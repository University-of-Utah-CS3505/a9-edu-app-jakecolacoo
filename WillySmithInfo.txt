Willy “The Lion” Smith was a central figure in the New York City jazz scene during the roaring 1920s. He performed at the most fashionable nightclubs in Harlem, accompanied other musicians on recordings, and inspired and mentored a host of younger musicians. Although he recorded rarely during the 1920s, he was the first musical director of Mamie Smith’s Jazz Hounds and is the pianist on “Crazy Blues“, the first Blues record released in 1920. Smith was a major influence on Duke Ellington who later went on to write songs in honor of him.
