Bob Dylan, born Robert Zimmerman, was a foundational figure in 1960s music and modern folk music as a whole. His poetic lyrics, blending folk, rock, and blues, revolutionized songwriting and challenged the status quo. Dylan’s songs like “Blowin’ in the Wind” and “The Times They Are a-Changin’” became anthems for the civil rights and anti-war movements, reflecting the era’s social unrest. His shift from acoustic to electric at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival marked a controversial event in rock history and helped further incorporate harsher rock sounds into folk music. Dylan’s influence on music and culture, coupled with his distinctive voice and insightful lyrics, solidified his legacy as one of the greatest songwriters of all time.
