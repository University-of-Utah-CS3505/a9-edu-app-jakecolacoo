The 1970s were largely a dynamic continuation of the revolutionary sounds from the 1960s, characterized by the advent of disco, punk, funk, and the continued evolution of rock music. Disco, with its upbeat rhythms and catchy melodies, dominated the dance floors. Punk rock, led by bands like The Ramones, emerged as a rebellious countercultural movement against the mainstream. Funk saw much broader mainstream appeal in this decade too, with artists like Stevie Wonder embracing its influence within melodic soul music. The '70s also saw the rise of reggae, popularized globally by Bob Marley.
