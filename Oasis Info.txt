Oasis was a British rock band at the forefront of the Britpop movement, setting themselves apart by embracing the excesses of rock stardom and drawing heavily from classic rock influences, particularly the Beatles. Britpop was a British musical movement that was a reaction to the Seattle-led grunge scene in the United States. Britpop brought a lighter, more celebratory, and rhythmic twist to alternative rock. Their music was marked by a unique mix of boldness and sentimentality and helped revive older classic rock sounds from the 1960s and 1970s.
