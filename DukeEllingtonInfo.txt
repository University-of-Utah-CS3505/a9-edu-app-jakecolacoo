Duke Ellington, one of the greatest jazz composers, had a profound impact on music in the 1920s. He was one of the originators of big-band jazz. In 1923, he moved to New York and formed his own band, the Washingtonians. By 1927, his band secured an engagement at Harlem’s famous Cotton Club. He composed thousands of scores, creating a distinctive ensemble sound. His contributions to jazz and American music during this period were enormous. His debut recording, “Choo Choo (I Got To Hurry Home)”, was released in 1924.
