Duke Ellington is widely regarded as one of the greatest jazz composers and bandleaders of all time. He was one of the originators of big-band jazz. With his exceptional musicians, he made hundreds of recordings, appeared in films and on radio, and toured Europe in 1933 and 1939. His ensemble allowed him to break away from the conventions of band-section scoring. He was responsible for many innovations in the jazz field, such as the introduction of “jungle-style” musical variations and the manipulation of the human voice as an instrument.
