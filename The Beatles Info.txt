The Beatles are widely considered the greatest rock band of all time. Their innovative songwriting and recording techniques, blending different music styles, set new standards for pop music. They pioneered the concept album, explored a wide range of musical styles, introduced Eastern music to Western audiences, and were one of the first rock bands to integrate orchestration into rock music in songs like “Yesterday” and “Day in the Life.” Their global popularity initiated the “British Invasion”, in which many British Rock bands saw soaring popularity in the US music market. Each member of the Beatles went on to achieve tremendous solo success after the eventual break-up of the band in 1970.
