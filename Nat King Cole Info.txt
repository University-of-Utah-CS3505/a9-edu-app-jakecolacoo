Nat King Cole was an influential pianist of the swing era and began his rise to stardom in the 1940s. His unique piano style and rhythm made his trio one of the tightest ensembles. He was the first black American to have his own network radio show, and his trio was named the “best small combo of the year” and “the major influence on the music of the 1940s” by Down Beat magazine. His smooth baritone voice and jazz-infused style were a prominent musical force of the 1940s.
