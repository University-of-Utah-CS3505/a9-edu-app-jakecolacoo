Kanye West’s influence on 2000s hip-hop was transformative. His debut album, “The College Dropout,” shifted focus from gangsta rap to more diverse themes like mental health, fame, race, and social issues. From his early beginnings as a producer, his soulful samples defined the sound of Roc-A-Fella Records. His work on Jay-Z’s “The Blueprint” introduced a soul influence, contrasting with the prevailing Timbaland sound. Tracks like “Stronger” showcased his electronic experimentation with rap music, while his use of AutoTune on “808s & Heartbreak” inspired the future of more introspective, melodic rap.
