Bing Crosby, known as one of the first multi-media stars, had a profound influence on music in the 1930s. He was one of the best-selling musicians of all time and dominated the charts of the 1930s. Crosby got his start by recording with popular orchestras and soon found solo success with a weekly radio show. His early career coincided with recording innovations that allowed him to develop an intimate singing style that influenced many male singers who followed. Around the mid-1930s, Crosbyâ€™s voice became lower, focusing on ballads that were more suited for mass appeal.
