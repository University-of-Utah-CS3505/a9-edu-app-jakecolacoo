The 1990s sounds largely grew from a rejection of musical trends from the 1980s, marked by the emergence of grunge, hip-hop, and electronic music. The Seattle-based grunge sub-genre, with its raw and distorted sounds, was a stark contrast to the previous decadeâ€™s flamboyant glam rock. Hip-hop, led by artists like Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls, emerged as a powerful platform for expressing the plight of inner-city life. Electronic genres like house and techno, with their synthesized beats, dominated the international dance scene. The '90s also saw the rise of pop icons like Mariah Carey, whose vocal prowess influenced a generation of artists.
