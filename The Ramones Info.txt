The Ramones was a New York-based punk rock band formed in 1974 and were pivotal figures in the development of punk. They are often cited as the first true punk rock group. Their back-to-basics approach and unique style significantly influenced new music around the world. They worked against the tendency of corporate rock music to become bloated with over-production and long, indulgent guitar solos and complex orchestration. With their visual trademarks of long hair, leather jackets, and torn jeans, the Ramones helped create the look as well as the sound of the late 1970s punk revolution.
