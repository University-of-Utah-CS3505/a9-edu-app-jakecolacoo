Salt-N-Pepa was the pioneering female rap group of the 1980s and had a profound impact on Hip-Hop’s role in the music industry. They broke barriers in a male-dominated genre, becoming one of the first all-female rap groups. Their 1986 hit “Push It” became a global phenomenon, blending hip-hop with more pop sensibilities. Their bold lyrics often addressed social issues, particularly those affecting women, which was groundbreaking at the time. Their success paved the way for future female artists in Hip-Hop and helped popularize Hip-Hop across the board to become a mainstream genre.
