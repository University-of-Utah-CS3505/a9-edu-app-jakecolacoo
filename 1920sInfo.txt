The 1920s, often referred to as the Roaring Twenties, was a period of significant innovation and growth in music. Jazz, a new style of music that combined elements of blues, ragtime, marching music, and African folk rhythms, emerged as the dominant musical trend of this era. The 1920s also saw huge advancements in new methods of electrical recording, leading to the large-scale commercialism and consumption of recorded music as we know it today.
