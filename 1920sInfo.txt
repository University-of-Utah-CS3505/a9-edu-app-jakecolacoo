The 1920s, known as the Jazz Age, saw the rise of jazz, blues, Broadway musicals, dance bands, and ragtime. Jazz, with its fusion of diverse influences, was the most influential genre. Broadway musicals featured happy endings and large dance numbers. New technologies like radio and gramophone helped distribute music to a wider audience.
