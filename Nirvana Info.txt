Nirvana had a huge impact on the music industry of the 1990s. Their fusion of punk rock with melodic accessibility resonated with listeners beyond the alternative music scene and was instrumental in forming the sub-genre of rock known as Grunge. The success of their album “Nevermind” opened the floodgates for a wave of grunge, reshaping the musical zeitgeist of the early '90s. Nirvana’s unique sound and style pushed out the large-scale production and glamor of the rock bands of the 80s and Nirvana soared to the top of the charts. Nirvana’s reign came to an abrupt end after the premature death of its lead singer, Kurt Cobain, but their impact on the music of the 90s was explosive nevertheless.
