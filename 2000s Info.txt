The 2000s were marked by a surge in popularity of electronica, hip-hop, R&B, and pop punk.  Hip-hop began to dominate the charts, as artists like Kanye West and Jay Z paved the path forward for the genre. Electronic music hit the mainstream as technological advances expanded the possibility for experimentation. Rock music began to slowly lose prominence on the charts, while subgenres such as emo and alternative rock gained popularity and amassed dedicated fan bases. The consumption and availability of music also changed with the birth of digital music platforms like iTunes and products like the iPod.
