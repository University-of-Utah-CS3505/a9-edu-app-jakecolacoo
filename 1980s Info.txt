The 1980s were MTV's decade, revolutionizing the music industry with iconic videos from Michael Jackson and Madonna. The reign of funk and disco began to fade as this decade ushered in the integration of more electronic and synthetic sounds through the emergence of new wave and synth-pop. The 80s also witnessed the rise of hair metal, a subgenre of rock music known for its flamboyant style and anthemic sound. Meanwhile, Hip-Hop slowly emerged as a mainstream musical genre, with artists like Public Enemy and Salt-N-Pepa at the forefront.
