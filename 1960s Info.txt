The music of the 1960s was a significant vehicle for the decadeâ€™s social changes, with folk music and psychedelia serving as soundtracks to the sexual revolution and anti-war protests. The British invasion, in which several prominent British rock bands achieved massive levels of fame throughout the world, marked the further globalization of rock music. Funk music, with its hard syncopated bass lines and drum beats, and Motown, a style of soul music with a distinct pop influence, also emerged during this period as prominent influences.
