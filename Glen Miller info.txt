Glenn Miller, one of the most successful band leaders of the big band era in the 1930s and 1940s, rose from humble beginnings. His music defined an era, with hits like “A String of Pearls,” “Tuxedo Junction,” and “Chattanooga Choo Choo” making him a household name. His distinctive sound, particularly the grouping of clarinet and saxophones, ushered in a unique sound in popular dance-band music. His music was met with wide acclaim, even in the army where he volunteered to serve as a band leader in 19421.
