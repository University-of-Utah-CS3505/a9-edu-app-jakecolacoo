Bruce Springsteen effortlessly adapted to the MTV age, reaching unprecedented popularity, especially with the peak of “Born to Run”.  His style of rock music was inspired by historical themes and events, especially those related to working-class America and social and political issues. His albums “Darkness on the Edge of Town” and “The River” continued themes of economic and personal dissolution, and are seen as kickstarting the heartland rock movement. His storytelling ability, every-man lyrics, and anthemic choruses have left a lasting impact on the music industry.
