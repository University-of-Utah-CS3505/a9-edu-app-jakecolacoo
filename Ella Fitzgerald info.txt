Ella Fitzgerald, known as the "First Lady of Song," was one of the superstars of the 1940s and an all-time musical great. Her unique voice and style were featured prominently on the 1940s musical soundtrack. Her records were even sent to a besieged London during World War II, where her hit songs kept civilians occupied during the long hours of the Blitz. Her collaborations with top jazz musicians of her time, from Count Basie to Dizzy Gillespie, elevated the status of vocal jazz.
