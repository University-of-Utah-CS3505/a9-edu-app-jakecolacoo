Sidney Bechet, a master of the soprano saxophone, was a significant figure in the 1920s music scene. He started on the clarinet and later discovered the soprano saxophone, an instrument rarely played in jazz at that time. He mastered this difficult instrument, giving the soprano saxophone a prominent place in jazz as a solo instrument. Bechet made his first recordings in 1923 and 1924 with Clarence Williams’ Blue Five, which also featured Louis Armstrong. These are among the most remarkable recordings in early jazz. His unique sound resonates throughout in classic Bechet recordings of “Summertime”, “St. Louis Blues”, and his famous composition, “Petit Fleur”.
