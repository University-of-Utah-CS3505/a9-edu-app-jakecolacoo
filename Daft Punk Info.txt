Daft Punk was a French electronic duo that revolutionized the sound of the 2000s with their unique blend of house, funk, rock, hip-hop, and pop. Their innovative use of filter effects and sidechain compression became a staple in pop music. Their albums, particularly “Discovery”, introduced a new voice to electronic music and are considered some of the most influential electronic dance records of all time. They also paved the way for the global rise of Electronic Dance Music (EDM) in the late-2000s. Their influence extended beyond creating hit songs, as they opened up new sonic landscapes of the 2000s.
