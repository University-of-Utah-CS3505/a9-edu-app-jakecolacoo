King Oliver, an American jazz cornet player and bandleader, was a significant figure in the 1920s music scene. He was known for his pioneering use of mutes in jazz and his unique playing style. Oliver composed many tunes that are still played today, including “Dippermouth Blues”, “Sweet Like This”, “Canal Street Blues”, and “Doctor Jazz”. He was also the mentor of Louis Armstrong, whose influence on jazz is immeasurable. In the mid-1920s, Oliver expanded his band to nine musicians, performing as King Oliver and his Dixie Syncopators, and began using more written arrangements with jazz solos.
