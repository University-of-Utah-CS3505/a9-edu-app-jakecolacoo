Jelly Roll Morton was a pioneering jazz composer, pianist, and band leader in the 1920s. He integrated complex arrangements, introduced a sense of improvisation, and expanded the possibilities of jazz instrumentation. He blended the styles of ragtime, classical music, popular songs, and the blues. He gave jazz a lighter, more rhythmically dynamic feeling. His composition “Jelly Roll Blues”, published in 1915, was one of the first published jazz compositions. He also claimed to have invented the genre. Morton also wrote “King Porter Stomp”, “Wolverine Blues”, “Black Bottom Stomp”, and “I Thought I Heard Buddy Bolden Say”.
