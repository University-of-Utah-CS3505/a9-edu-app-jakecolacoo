The 1950s was a revolutionary decade in music, marked by the rise of rock and roll, which started a dramatic shift from jazz and standards to modern pop music. This new genre combined elements of beat-heavy jump blues, boogie-woogie, up-tempo jazz, and swing music, creating a sound that truly shook the world. Major rock artists of the 1950s include Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, and Little Richard. The decade also saw the rise of Doo-Wop and the growth of Nashville country music with artists like Johnny Cash.
