They were pioneers of hard rock and heavy metal, pushing the limits and challenging ideals when it came to making music with harsher rock sounds. They were rooted in blues but added a darker, heavier sound that helped lead to the prominence and development of heavy metal. Their influence extended to rock bands from the '80s onwards, setting the template for hard rock.
