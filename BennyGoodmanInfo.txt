Benny Goodman, known as the "King of Swing", had a significant influence on music in the 1930s. His early influences were New Orleans jazz clarinetists working in Chicago. In 1933, he met jazz admirer John Henry Hammond, who inspired him to join a jazz band. Goodman's bands started the careers of many jazz musicians. Notably, he led one of the first integrated jazz groups, his trio and quartet. His concert at Carnegie Hall in 1938 is described as "the single most important jazz or popular music concert in history".
