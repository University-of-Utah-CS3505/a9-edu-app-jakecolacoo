Lady Gagaâ€™s influence on the pop music scene in the 2000s was transformative. Her unique sound, combined with her impressive vocal talent, catchy dance tunes, dramatic performances, and unconventional fashion sense, redefined mainstream music. Drawing inspiration from other eccentric artists like David Bowie, Madonna, Freddie Mercury, and Andy Warhol, she released groundbreaking albums like The Fame Monster in 2009. Her songs tackled a wide array of topics, from love and loss to identity and self-reflection, as well as societal issues such as freedom, sexuality, substance abuse, and mental health.
