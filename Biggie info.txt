Christopher Wallace, known as The Notorious B.I.G. or Biggie Smalls, was a central figure in East Coast hip-hop during the 1990s. His storytelling ability, coupled with his distinctive flow and clever wordplay pushed the genre forward and contributed to shifting the focus in Hip-Hop away from DJs and towards MCs. His debut album, ‘Ready to Die’, is considered a classic with its raw narratives about crime and hardship. Biggie’s music often contrasted bleak content with smooth beats and helped shift the genre’s epicenter from the West to the East Coast. Biggie died at the young age of 24, but he managed to inspire countless artists and contributed greatly to the evolution of hip-hop.
